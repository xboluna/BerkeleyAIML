Capstone: Initial Question and Data

Generalized image classficiation/tagging (I recognize this is pretty general). I work for a company which could benefit from the ability to automatically tag photos so that they can be sorted into broad categories.

I would need a large library of labelled images, with plenty of examples for each label. This will also include defining the threshold for the 'minimum' number of examples per label to be able to categorize an image.

I might be able to source these images from the company that I work for. If not, I have found a number of image libraries on Kaggle.
